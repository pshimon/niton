ultraviolet wrapper produce BF (bug free) program from PBF (practically bug free ) source written in any language. It works by adding niton language symbols in such a way that rules of source language are not violated (e.g not inside identifiers). After this transformation source is processed as usual (e.g compiled or executed line by line). It is possible to prove rigorously that such trasformation properly made do not introduce new bugs. So PBF becomes BF.
